If his skill doesn\'t improve at all, that is not a problem of deliberate practice, it\'s a problem that he didn\'t practice the same skill every day. He is not practicing a specific skill (draw the eye of the portrait). Although the lack of feedback is also important, it\'s more important to focus on the same practice)","2":"The task of creating a portrait is a complex one and should be studied step by step rather than in full. Hence, Rajeev should identify what parts of the portrait are problematic and practice them regularly instead of drawing new full portrait every day.","3":"lack of deliberate practice, to say, always practice a general and broad task set without pinpointing where exactly is not good.","13":"He doesn\'t have a teacher who supervises him and diagnoses his errors.","25":"No, because deliberate practice requires that an external agent provide feedback to the learner.","26":"Not exactly. To engage in deliberate practice, one must be given explicit instruction about the best method. Since Dan is simply reflecting on his own method and has never compared it with a best method given to him by an expert, this step is not met. You could perhaps argue that the second component of deliberate practice is met, he is his own teacher and diagnosis his own errors. But without the first point, this is meaningless. Finally, the third part of deliberate practice of getting informative feedback and remedial training could be argued that he\'s doing this for himself. But again, without being able to compare it with a best method, this is meaningless.","29":"because he is not getting task feedback from an external agent, and he is not able to practice corrections immediately.","30":"No, since he receives no feedback on how well he does. Also, the feedback was not immediate.","31":"no, because he needs an instructor to provide informative feedback","34":"Not receiving immediate feedback may make Rajeev not yield an improvement.","44":"No, he needs external agent to give informative feedback, as he may be \\"unskilled and unaware of it\\". Also he needs to receive informative feedback and practise again in a loop which he can not do in the described way.","48":"Remind him of long term goals, and the growth that is still possible and how his current achievement reflects that. Basically tell him how great he\'s done and tell him he\'s going to continue to better in the future.","49":"Great work, you see, your practice did pay off.","51":"Great job. Keep working and putting effort, you will improve more quickly.","53":"You did a great job putting efforts into practice and it paid off!","57":"You have improved a lot!","58":"What a great job that you achieved the goal of playing your favorite song. It is also great for your persistence of learning and practicing.","61":"Great effort! You persisted even when it was frustrating, and now you can play your favorite song! If you stay determined like that, you can learn to play anything!","80":"Yes, because it gives them the confidence that they can master a concept enough to teach others and help others do well when tested on that concept.","81":"Since the Jigsaw method does not reveal the details of how it is effective, we cannot assess if it actually creates a growth-intelligence mindset as it could also be attributed to a talent in that given domain that was not previously exposed. It could create a growth-intelligence mindset, but it\'s not a guarantee. Hence, my answer is no.","82":"Yes indeed! The jigsaw method creates a growth mindset because through the process students are going through walks them through a process in which their own competence is demonstrated back to them and they are supported by the other students on their team. This translates to them feeling their own ability to succeed and increase their intelligence in the future.","83":"Yes, students are encouraged to learn , express, they are seeing others rely on themselves and see themselves improve.","86":"I think it does. Especially for those low-achieving students, Jigsaw enables them to learn from other members (in the expert group as well as Jigsaw group), knowing that they could also learn as well as their peers. Also, as Jigsaw team will rely on one another to learn that part of knowledge, each person will feel that they are making contributions.","90":"Yes, for example carlos, have developed a growth-mindset, while he thought he was stupid he later think he is smart.","91":"According to the reading, Carlos changed his mindset because his groupmates think he was someone they could work with and someone they could appreciate."},"Question_id":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"13":1,"25":2,"26":2,"29":2,"30":2,"31":2,"34":2,"44":2,"48":3,"49":3,"51":3,"53":3,"57":3,"58":3,"61":3,"80":4,"81":4,"82":4,"83":4,"86":4,"90":4,"91":4},"Student_score_on_question":{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"13":1,"25":0.5,"26":0.75,"29":0.75,"30":0.75,"31":0.75,"34":0.75,"44":1,"48":0.5,"49":0.75,"51":0.75,"53":0.75,"57":0.5,"58":0.5,"61":1,"80":0,"81":1,"82":0,"83":0,"86":0,"90":0,"91":0},"Student_choice_on_question":{"0":"B","1":"B","2":"B","3":"B","13":"A","25":"C, D","26":"B","29":"B","30":"B","31":"B","34":"B","44":"B, C","48":"A, B","49":"B","51":"B","53":"B","57":"B, C","58":"B, C","61":"B, D","80":"A","81":"C","82":"A","83":"B","86":"A","90":"A","91":"B"},"Quiz_score":{"0":6,"1":8.5,"2":8,"3":6.75,"13":6,"25":8.5,"26":6.75,"29":7.75,"30":6.75,"31":9.75,"34":4.75,"44":6,"48":6,"49":6,"51":7,"53":9,"57":8,"58":7,"61":7,"80":8,"81":7.75,"82":7.5,"83":8,"86":7,"90":6.5,"91":7.75},"Average_quizzes_score":{"0":7.8,"1":8,"2":8.1,"3":6.7,"13":7,"25":8,"26":7.2,"29":6.8,"30":7,"31":7.7,"34":6.7,"44":7.3,"48":7,"49":7.2,"51":6.8,"53":7.7,"57":7.7,"58":6.7,"61":7.5,"80":7,"81":7.1,"82":8.1,"83":8,"86":6.8,"90":7.7,"91":6.9},"Question_text":{"0":"Every morning, Rajeev spends an hour alone drawing a portrait from a photograph in the day’s newspaper to improve his portraiture skills (skills drawing a portrait).
